    <h1>Kaylie's Library</h1>
    <p class="flex margin">I have been an avid reader since junior year of high school. In 2023, I read 50 books and
        this year, my goal is 40 books. I read nonfiction, fantasy, romance, and literary fiction.
        This page serves as a curated space to document and share the books that leave a lasting impression on me. If
        you share my love for books, don't hesitate to reach out.

                <p>I already knew from the start of this book that it would be special. There are times when you are
                    reading a book
                    and you feel disconnected, disengaged, or even uninterested. However, this book made me feel seen,
                    warm, and loved? It was strangely cathartic.
                </p>
                <p>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a tale of two best friends who make video games together.
                    However, it goes much deeper than just
                    a story. It taps into themes of friendship, life meaning, loss, disability, and the human condition.

                <p>This book made me laugh and cry (several times).</p>
                <p class="quote"><span class="retro">"SADIE MIRANDA GREEN, YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!"</span> Sam could
                    be ignored, but the childish shared reference could not be. It was an invitation to play. She
                    turned.</p>
                <p>Throughout my time reading this book, I couldn't be without a highlighter. The writing
                    was superb; it evoked emotions.
                </p>
                <p>Yes, a hundred times yes I recommend this book.</p>
