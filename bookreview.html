    <h1>Kaylie's Library</h1>
    <p class="middle">I have been an avid reader since junior year of high school. In 2023, I read 50 books and
        this year, my goal is 40 books. I read nonfiction, fantasy, romance, and literary fiction.
        This page serves as a curated space to document and share the books that leave a lasting impression on me. If
        you share my love for books, don't hesitate to reach out.

    <p class="middle">I am taking a pause on implementing this website to prioritize learning web development. My vision
        for this library page tells me that I need more knowledge of frameworks. I think brute-forcing everything on
        HTML and CSS will not get me as far as I would like. My intentions with this page will hopefully be brought to
        life in the next coming weeks! </p>
