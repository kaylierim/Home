                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">"The Complete Web Development Bootcamp,"</a> an online course offered by Udemy.
                    I actively apply the concepts I learn from this course by implementing them on my
                    website. This hands-on approach not only reinforces my understanding but also forces me to work with
                    the resources available to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing from my background as a graphic designer for my church youth group, my solid
                    foundation in design theories allow me to enhance
                    the visual appeal and user experience of my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in front-end, consumer-side work. However, given that I still have much to learn, I
                    am
                    open to all experiences in computer science. My future endeavors include learning about mobile
                    development.
